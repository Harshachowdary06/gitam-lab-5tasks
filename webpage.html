            <p id="p1"> A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock.
              <br> A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land </p>

           <p id="p2">A river is a stream of water that flows through a channel in the surface of the ground. <br>
              The passage where the river flows is called the river bed and the earth on each side is called a river bank. <br>
               A river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground, because of gravity. <br>
             A river begins as a small stream, and gets bigger the farther it flows.</p>
